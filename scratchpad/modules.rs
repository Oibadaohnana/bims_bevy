// The crate's modules, declared once. Every probe `include!`s this rather than
// carrying its own copy: when they each had one, adding a new crates/game/src/*.rs meant
// every probe but the newest failed to *compile*, and rustc failing leaves the
// previous binary in place — so running one printed a confident pass from
// stale code. Three separate rounds of that happened.
