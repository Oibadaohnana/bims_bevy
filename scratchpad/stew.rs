// Stew for the store: does the target make a job, does the job make a stew,
// and does a hungry Bim eat it?
//
// The manager's stew target is the whole of the demand. Below it, with a
// vegetable and a block of tofu on the shelf, `work_on_offer` puts
// `Job::Cook` on the list — stew for the store is the cook row's, beside a
// meal — and the Bim chops one of each, cooks them, packs the pot into a
// tub and puts it in the cold store. At the target the shelf stops asking. And a Bim that is then hungry warms one up rather than
// cooking from raw, which is what keeps the loop going.
//
// Read off the counts and the chosen job, not off where the Bim is seen
// standing — see the note at the top of `priority.rs` for why.
