// been bursting, how long it has stood in the mess, how long since it was
// last sick — used to live on `Filth`, which is the *deck*, and there is one
// deck. With two crew aboard `Filth::update` ran twice a frame on the same
// object, so whichever Bim was comfortable zeroed the other's clock on the
// way past. Nobody ever reached the hour. Nobody ever had an accident.
