// Food poisoning: a meal cooked in a dirty galley makes the Bim ill.
//
// Every tile within two of the hob with a real mess on it — a wetting or
// worse, not the stain a meal leaves — is a one-in-five
// chance the meal is bad, rolled the moment the pot finishes cooking or a
// bowl is filled. A Bim that
// eats from a bad pot is ill for two days: the restroom need runs three
// times as fast, and reaching nothing is the accident straight away rather
// than an hour of holding on.
//
// Read off the pot and the clocks, not off where the Bim is seen standing —
// see the note at the top of `priority.rs` for why.
