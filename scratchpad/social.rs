//
// The **ordinary** half is two Bims who talk to each other several times a day
// and are never lonely. That runs itself: start a game, leave it a week, and check
// nobody ever reaches the first stage.
//
// The **other** half takes a fortnight of game days to reach and is the part nobody will
// ever see by accident. Waiting for it is not an option — so the solitude
// clock is pinned forward with `leave_alone_for_probe`, re-pinned every frame
// so that the other Bim striking up a conversation cannot quietly reset it,
// and what is watched is the fallout. Pinning rather than switching autonomy
// off matters: a Bim with autonomy off does not eat either, and a run that
// starves its subject is measuring starvation.
