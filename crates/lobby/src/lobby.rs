//! What the World tab holds: one galaxy, every system in it, the star being
//! looked at, and the marks the page has asked for.
//!
//! # "Has a station" is answered by generating the system
//!
//! [`worldgen::Galaxy::designation_for`] only knows about the five stars
//! *promised* a station. A quarter of the rest roll one on their own, and a
//! promised one can still lose it — a station with nowhere in its own system
//! to fly to is pruned. So the only way to answer "which stars can the game
//! start at" that agrees with what [`worldgen::Galaxy::system`] will actually
//! build is to build them, once per galaxy, and keep the answer. A thousand
//! systems is a few dozen draws each; it is done once, when the seed or the
//! type changes, and never again.
//!
//! The inspected system is **not** read from that cache. It is generated
//! afresh from `Galaxy::system`, which costs nothing and means the harness's
//! comparison of "reported as having a station" against "what inspecting it
//! lists" is a comparison of two paths rather than of one path with itself.
//!
//! # A crew cannot start at an enemy's
//!
//! Some of the stations somebody lives on are hostile
//! (`StationBlueprint::hostile`): docked there the crew are the enemy and
//! the people aboard shoot. The map still shows the star as having a
//! station — it does, and it is somewhere to fly to — but the start has to
//! be somewhere else, so `can_start` is kept beside `has_station`, and the
//! two ways a start gets picked ([`Lobby::random_start`] and
//! [`Lobby::can_start_at`], which the page asks before it offers "Start
//! here") both refuse a hostile station. The rule is here rather than on the
//! page so that a page and a server agree about it.
