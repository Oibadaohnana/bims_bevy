//! The galaxy preview: a camera over the star field, the pick under the
//! pointer, and the shapes that draw it.
//!
//! **Everything comes out in screen pixels.** The room and the designer emit
//! shapes in world units and hand the host a scale and an offset to paint
//! them through; this one does the projection itself and reports a transform
//! of one. A galaxy is fifty thousand light years across and a star on it is
//! two pixels wide whatever the zoom, so nearly every shape here is sized in
//! pixels already — projecting the *position* and leaving the rest alone is
//! the arithmetic that wants doing, and doing it in one place keeps the pick
//! and the paint agreeing about where a star is.
//!
//! North is up and the camera never rotates, for the same reason the game
//! view's does not: a map you learn is a map that holds still.
