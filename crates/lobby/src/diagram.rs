//! The system diagram: one star's system, fitted to the side panel.
//!
//! Normalised to the panel rather than drawn to a scale. Systems differ in
//! span by an order of magnitude and the panel is a fixed few hundred
//! pixels, so the star goes in the middle, the furthest thing goes near the
//! edge, and everything else lands in proportion. **No distances are shown
//! and none can be read off it** — that is deliberate. The lobby is where a
//! start is chosen, not where a system is explored, and a diagram a player
//! could measure would be a diagram that did the exploring for them.
//!
//! The same twelve-float format as the preview, into the same buffer, drawn
//! one after the other by the host. Positions come out in panel pixels with
//! north up; where each body and station landed is handed back so the host
//! can label them — the words are its, as always.
