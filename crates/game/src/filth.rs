//! Mess: what is on the deck, what is on the Bim, and what that does to it.
//!
//! The deck is scored tile by tile. A tile starts at [`BASELINE`] and goes down
//! as things happen on it, with an accident taking one straight to [`FOULED`],
//! the worst there is. A broom is the one thing that puts it back — see
//! [`Filth::sweep`], and the chain behind it in `task.rs`. The Bim carries its
//! own share of it around separately, because a Bim that soils itself takes the
//! mess with it when it walks away, and no broom reaches that.
//!
//! Mess spreads, by two routes. The dirty jobs — cooking, planting, lifting a
//! crop — flick something onto the deck around the Bim as each step of them
//! finishes ([`Filth::spatter`]). And boots carry what is already down from
//! one tile to the next ([`Filth::track`]): a quarter of the crossings move a
//! quarter of the tile, so a trail thins fast and dies out rather than
//! working its way across the ship.
//!
//! The surroundings *need* is not a clock like hunger. It follows two things
//! at once: the average of the tiles within [`REACH`] of where the Bim is
//! standing, lifted by whatever **comforts** stand about it — a plant, a
//! picture, `shipdesign::comfort` — and how filthy the Bim itself is.
//! Standing in a clean room with clean hands it recovers; anything else and
//! it falls, faster the worse the mess. The lift is [`Filth::set_comforts`]:
//! a layer of its own over the tiles, laid once from the layout and never
//! swept or spattered, so a plant beside a spill makes the spill bearable
//! and a fouled tile stays fouled underneath it.
//!
//! Everything a mess *does* to the Bim is on a clock rather than a level, the
//! same as malnutrition in `health.rs`: reaching nothing is the start of it,
//! not the end, and each stage is an hour further in.
