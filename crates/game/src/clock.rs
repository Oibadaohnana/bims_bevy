//! Everything in the game that is measured in wall-clock time — how long a nap
//! lasts, when it gets dark — goes through here, so there is one definition of
//! how fast a day passes rather than a rate copied into each caller.

//! The clock runs off the same `dt` as the rest of the simulation, which means
//! the speed slider carries it along too: at 24x a day takes one minute.
