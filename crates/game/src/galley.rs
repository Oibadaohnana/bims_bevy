//! The galley's fixtures, one struct each, so a room can have several of
//! any of them.
//!
//! The room used to keep the whole galley as loose fields — one hob's
//! heat, one board's slices, one fridge's door — and every chain step read
//! them directly, which is exactly what made a second hob a coloured block
//! nobody could cook on. Now each fixture carries its own state and the
//! room holds a list of each kind; a chain **picks** one when it first
//! needs one — the closest that nobody else has — and keeps it for the
//! rest of that errand (`task::Picks`). What is *shared* stays on the
//! room: the cold store's counts, the drawer's plate count, the dish being
//! cooked. A cold store is a class of storage, not a box, and a plate is a
//! plate whichever drawer it came out of.
