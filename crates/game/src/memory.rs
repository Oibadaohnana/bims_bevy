//! What a Bim remembers of its days.
//!
//! A diary rather than a log, and a short one: nothing goes in unless it
//! actually mattered. Accidents, illness, going hungry, going without sleep,
//! going without company, and what it saw happen to the other one — including
//! the other one dying. A day in which the crew simply got on with their work
//! leaves **no entry at all**, which is the intended reading of an empty page.
//!
//! It used to keep the day's work too, and the result was a wall of "Used the
//! toilet." to scroll past before reaching the one line worth having.
//!
//! **No strings live here.** Every entry is a day, a time, a code and one
//! number, and the host turns those into a sentence — the same rule the rest
//! of this boundary keeps. A Bim that remembers "I was sick in the galley"
//! remembers `(day 4, 18:22, WasSick, 0)`, and "in the galley" is the host's
//! wording of nothing at all.

/// How many entries a Bim keeps. Long enough to hold a good few days, short
/// enough that a Bim left running for a game year does not grow without bound
/// — the oldest fall off the front. Memory is finite; so is this.
