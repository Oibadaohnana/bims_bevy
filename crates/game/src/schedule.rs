//! A day's timetable, one slot per hour.

//! Only sleep is timetabled for now; every other hour is left as *anything*,
//! which means the Bim carries on choosing for itself from what it wants. So
//! the schedule is not a rota the Bim obeys to the letter — it is a standing
//! instruction to go to bed at a particular time of day, and one it is allowed
//! to decline.
//!
//! It declines when it is not tired enough to be worth it. A Bim sent to bed
//! at nine tenths rested would be up again almost at once, which is worse than
//! not going: it is a walk to the bunk, a climb, and a walk back.
