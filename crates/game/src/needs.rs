//! What the Bim wants, and when it wants it.
//!
//! Five levels, each running from 1 (comfortable) down to 0. A level falling
//! past [`URGENT`] is what sets the matching errand going; doing the thing
//! fills it back up. Everything else about the Bim's day follows from these
//! numbers.
//!
//! Four of them run on the clock. The odd one out, surroundings, has no clock
//! and no errand behind it: it follows the state of the deck the Bim is
//! standing on — the mess about it, and what is there to cheer it — and of the
//! Bim itself, and what it does when it runs out is in
//! `filth.rs`. Company is the newest and the only one that needs *another Bim*
//! rather than a fixture — what going without it does is in `social.rs`.
//!
//! The rates are not picked by eye. Each one is written as the drop from full
//! to the trigger, divided by how long that is supposed to take, so the daily
//! counts are readable in the arithmetic rather than buried in a decimal.
//!
//! Nothing drains while the Bim is asleep. That is a deliberate choice and it
//! is what makes the counts come out exactly: if the restroom need ran down
//! through the night, six hours in bed would end well past the trigger, the Bim
//! would get up needing the heads immediately, and the three-a-day would drift
//! into four. Sleeping through the night is the whole point of sleeping.
