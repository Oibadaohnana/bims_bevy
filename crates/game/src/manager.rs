//! What the player has told the place to keep in stock.
//!
//! Five numbers — vegetables, blocks of tofu, pots of stew and fibre in the
//! cold store, and the dressings each Bim is to carry — and everything
//! automated reads its target off this rather
//! than being told separately. The hydroponic bay plants to the first two
//! and the fourth; the galley cooks to the third, one stew out of a
//! vegetable and a block of tofu, and puts it in the cold store beside
//! them. Whatever comes next (water, spares, a second Bim's worth of
//! anything) belongs here beside them.
//!
//! They are set **separately**. They used to be one number in food units
//! that split two to one, which was the ratio a Bim ate at; a stew on the
//! shelf takes one of each, and a target that was one dial for three things
//! had no honest way to say "more soy". Fibre is not food at all — it is
//! what a bandage is made of — and starts at nought like the stew, so a
//! bay nobody has asked for it grows none.
