//! A powered door in a bulkhead, as a ship design places them.
//!
//! The classic room has one door — the heads' — and it is worked by hand:
//! the Bim walks to the panel, and the pathfinder keeps a grid for each of
//! its two states (`crate::nav::Maps`). A designed ship has a door in every
//! bulkhead, and a grid per combination of them is not a thing, so these
//! are **sliding doors that open by themselves**: a body walking up to one
//! opens it, and it shuts a moment after the doorway is clear. The
//! pathfinder walks straight through an unlocked one, open or shut, because
//! it will be open by the time the body gets there.
//!
//! What the player can do to one is the bathroom door's vocabulary — open,
//! close, lock, unlock — and it is done the bathroom door's way: the Bim
//! walks over and works it, through [`crate::room::Switch::Door`]. *Open*
//! holds it open, so it no longer shuts itself; *close* hands it back to
//! itself; *lock* shuts it and makes it a solid, which is the one state the
//! pathfinder has to know about, and the room rebuilds its grids when one
//! changes. A door that is told to lock while somebody is in the opening
//! waits for them: the panels never close on a body, and the lock takes
//! the moment the doorway is clear.
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a tile is. A door is a rect and which way it
//! runs, and `aboard.rs` is what works those out from a design.
