//! The bay grows what the cold store is short of. The manager sets three
//! targets (`manager.rs`) — vegetables, blocks of tofu and fibre, the crop
//! a bandage is made of — and the bay plants whichever of the three it is
//! furthest behind on. When all are met it **hibernates**: nothing grows,
//! nothing is planted, and whatever is in the trays is kept exactly as it is
//! until the store falls back under the mark.
//!
//! Nothing here happens by itself. The bay says what wants doing and the Bim
//! walks over and does it, one tray at a time, the same as every other switch
