//! One crew member: everything that belongs to a Bim rather than to the ship.
//!
//! Two of them live aboard and they are not distinguishable in code. Each has
//! its own needs, its own health, its own errand and its own queue of errands
//! put down; each has a berth and a seat at the table that the other never
//! uses. What they share is the room — one galley, one pot, one set of heads —
//! and `game.rs` is where the sharing is arbitrated.
//!
//! The only asymmetry is the player. [`PLAYER`] is the one the mouse steers;
//! the other lives exactly the same day entirely on its own account, which is
//! the whole point of it being there.
