//! The room, laid out from a ship design.
//!
//! This is where the two halves of the game meet: `crates/game` is the
//! Bims — their needs, their errands, the galley and the heads and the bay,
//! and the drawing of all of it — and `shipdesign` is the ship the player
//! laid out. Everything the room's errands walk to is a rect on a
//! [`Room`], and everything the designer placed is a part on a tile grid;
//! this module turns the second into the first, and nothing else in the
//! crate has heard of a `ShipDesign`.
//!
//! It is the one module the native probes do **not** stand up — they
//! declare the crate's modules by `#[path]` and link no other crate — which
//! is why the rest of the room takes a [`Layout`] of plain rects rather than
//! a design, and why this file is not in `scratchpad/modules.rs`.
//!
//! # What maps to what
//!
//! | part | the room's |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | cold store | fridge |
//! | worktop | counter, with the board and the drawer on it |
//! | hob | stove |
//! | dishwasher | dishwasher |
//! | table, chairs | table, seats |
//! | bunks | berths, in id order — Bim *i* sleeps in bunk *i* |
//! | broom locker | locker |
//! | hydroponic bay | bay, six trays along it, worked from its use spots' side |
//! | field | a bay on open ground, every one: half the pace, no plug (`More::fields`) |
//! | toilet, basin | the heads, with no bulkheads of their own |
//! | shower | the shower, used from its use spot; a solid the ship draws |
//! | smelter, workbench | a bench each, used from its use spot; solids the ship draws |
//! | suit locker | where a walk outside starts and ends; a solid the ship draws |
//! | shelf | where a load for a construction site is picked up; a solid the ship draws |
//! | airlock (the port) | the gangway inside it and the spot outside it, for a walk |
//! | door | a powered door — see `crate::door` |
//! | anything else a body cannot walk through | a solid the nav grid avoids |
//!
//! One of each, the first by id where the design has more. Every fixture is
//! used **from the south** — the Bim stands below it, as it stands below the
//! galley in the classic room — so a part turned to face another way is
//! used from the wrong side, and a part with a wall to its south is one the
//! crew cannot get at. That is the honest limit of this step, and it is
//! written down here rather than fixed, because fixing it is the room's
//! stations learning a direction each.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! Room units are ship-design world units: a tile is [`TILE`] of both, so a
//! design coordinate *is* a room coordinate and nothing is scaled on the way
//! across. The room's `interior` is the deck's bounding box, and every tile
//! inside that box that is not deck is a solid, so an L-shaped ship does not
//! get a room that thinks the missing corner is floor.
