//! What the crew can see.
//!
//! Every Bim sees all the way round — there is no cone — and what stops
//! its eyes is what stands in the way: the walls, the hull, the tall parts,
//! a door with its leaves shut. Sight is worked out on the room's tile
//! grid and it is **traced**: a tile is seen when the straight line from a
//! crew member's eyes to the tile's middle crosses nothing opaque on the
//! way, and the tile it stops at is seen too, so a wall is seen from the
//! room it walls. The crew share it — a tile one of them sees, all of
//! them see — because the crew are one crew and a screen is one screen.
//!
//! The mask is a picture and a fact at once: [`Game::render`] draws a fog
//! over every tile nobody sees, and the world asks [`Sight::seen_at`] for
//! whether a body on the station's deck is in anybody's view. It is
//! recomputed only when something that could change it has — an eye
//! crossed a tile, a door shut or opened — since a trace of every tile
//! from every eye is a few hundred thousand steps in a joined room.
//!
//! # Peeking round a wall
//!
//! A Bim standing **against** a wall — the tile beside it opaque — leans
//! out and looks along it: as well as from where it stands, it sees from
//! the free tile either side of it along the wall, and what those extra
//! eyes add is whatever lies **beyond the wall's line**. So a Bim pressed
//! to the corner of a room sees the whole of the room on the other side
//! of the corner, where one standing a tile back sees only the wedge the
//! corner leaves. [`Sight::eyes_from`] is the rule, and [`Sight::sees_from`]
//! asks it for one body and one target — a shot is fired from whichever
//! eye saw the enemy, so a peeking Bim shoots from the peek.
//!
//! # Whose the tiles are
//!
//! Every tile has a [`Stance`]: the crew's own ship is friendly, and a
//! station's tiles are whatever the world says the station is. What the
//! fog looks like over an unseen tile follows from that. A friendly
//! structure is under a **semi** fog — the deck stays readable, since the
//! crew know their own ship — while a neutral or hostile one is **black**
//! where nobody has looked, and **grey** in a ring [`RING`] tiles wide
//! round what is seen, where the structure shows but no body does. The
//! grey stays once earned: what has been looked at is known, and only
//! who is standing there is forgotten.
