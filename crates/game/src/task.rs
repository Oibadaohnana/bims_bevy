//! Scripted jobs the Bim carries out, one step at a time.
//!
//! A task is a straight line of [`Step`]s. Each step either sends the Bim
//! somewhere and waits for it to arrive, or holds it in place for a while
//! playing an animation. Anything the step changes about the world — a door
//! opening, a vegetable moving from hand to board — happens on the way in or
//! on the way out, so the state and what you can see never disagree.
