//! Deterministic randomness, drawn from a hash rather than from a stream.
//!
//! This is the part of the world generator that most wants getting right, and
//! the rule is short: **there is no global RNG here**. A shared stream would
//! mean the numbers a system gets depend on how many systems were generated
//! before it, which is a different thing on a client that has looked at four
//! stars and a server that has looked at nine hundred. Every draw instead
//! starts from a seed hashed out of what the thing *is* —
//! `(galaxy_seed, star_id, generator_version, purpose)` — so the same star
//! generates the same system whoever asks and in whatever order.
//!
//! [`Purpose`] is what keeps two draws about the same star apart. Without it,
//! the stream that names a star and the stream that scatters its planets are
//! the same stream, and adding a syllable to the naming would move every
//! planet in the galaxy. With it, each is its own sequence and the others do
//! not feel it — which is the whole of "changing system generation must never
//! move stars", written down as a type.
//!
//! The mixer is SplitMix64's finalizer: cheap, well-tested and — the part
//! that matters — the same arithmetic on every target, because it is all
//! integer. A float-based hash would give the wasm client and the native
//! server leave to disagree in the last bit, and one bit is a different
//! galaxy.
