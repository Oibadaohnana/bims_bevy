//! A point, at full width.
//!
//! The room's `Vec2` is `f32` and lives in the game crate, which is right for
//! a compartment forty tiles across and wrong for a galaxy: a system is a
//! hundred million units wide and there are fifty thousand light years of
//! galaxy around it, so a single-precision position loses metres at the far
//! end and whole hops at the further one.
//!
//! Everything out here is therefore `f64`, and it stays `f64` all the way
//! into the simulation. **Narrowing happens at draw time and nowhere else**:
//! rendering will subtract the ship's position first and convert what is left
//! — a screenful, never more — so the `f32` only ever holds a small number.
//! Nothing here may be reworked on the assumption that positions move to keep
//! the ship centred; they do not.
