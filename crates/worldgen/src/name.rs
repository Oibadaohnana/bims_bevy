//! Names, as numbers.
//!
//! **No strings cross the wasm boundary.** That rule is not relaxed for a
//! thousand stars — it is the reason there are a thousand of them and no
//! table of a thousand words anywhere. A [`Name`] is three small integers and
//! the host turns them into something to read, exactly as `SPOT_NAMES` and
//! `CREW_NAMES` already do for the room.
//!
//! # What the host has to hold
//!
//! Two word tables, and their lengths have to match [`STAR_WORDS`] and
//! [`STATION_WORDS`]. If the generator hands over `word: 40` and the host's
//! table has thirty entries, the name comes out blank or as `undefined` —
//! which is the same failure a missing `MEMORY_LINES` entry gives, and it
//! reads as the star not existing rather than as a table being short. A
//! generator that grows its tables therefore has to grow the host's in the
//! same commit.
//!
//! # How each kind is read
//!
//! | thing | rendered as | example |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | star | word, a dash, the number | `Tanis-284` |
//! | body | its star's name, then a roman numeral for `part` | `Tanis-284 III` |
//! | station | word, the number, and `part` as a mark if there is one | `Cordell Yard 7` |
//!
//! A body has no word of its own on purpose: a planet named independently of
//! its star reads as a second system. The host already has the star when it
//! draws the system, so the one number is all it is short of.
