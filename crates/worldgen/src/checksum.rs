//! One number that says whether two builds generated the same galaxy.
//!
//! The lobby draws the star map in wasm and a native server will one day
//! generate the same galaxy from the same seed, and the only cheap way to
//! find out that the two have drifted — a `powf` that rounds differently, a
//! `sin` out of a different libm — is to run a fixed seed on both and compare
//! each against the same written-down number. [`crate::fixture`] holds the
//! numbers; `crates/worldgen/src/tests.rs` is the native end and
//! `lobby_galaxy_checksum` in `crates/lobby` is the wasm end, read by
//! `scratchpad/builder-check.mjs`.
//!
//! # What goes in
//!
//! Everything a player can see or click: every star's position, class and
//! name, and — because "does this star have a station" has to be answered by
//! **generating the system** rather than by looking at the designations —
//! every system's bodies and stations, with their kinds, parents, positions
//! and names, what each station stocks, how its desk leans on every price,
//! and whose side it is on. A galaxy
//! whose stars all matched and whose stations did not would put two
//! players' spawn pickers on different stations — or one player's crew
//! ashore at a station the other's is shooting its way out of.
//!
//! # Why the floats are rounded
//!
//! The same reason `world::checksum` gives: `sin`, `cos` and `powf` come out
//! of the platform's libm natively and Rust's own on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`,
//! and those may differ in the last bit. Positions go onto a grid on the way
//! in — a hundredth of a light year across the galaxy, a thousandth of a unit
//! inside a system — which is far finer than any real divergence and far
//! coarser than a rounding one.
