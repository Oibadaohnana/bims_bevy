//! The star field: where the stars are, and what they are.
//!
//! This is the only part of world generation that is drawn all at once. There
//! are a thousand stars, each of them two numbers, a name and a class, and
//! holding the lot costs less than one system's worth of bodies — so the map
//! can be drawn, panned and clicked without generating anything.
//!
//! **Nothing in here may depend on what is inside a system.** The whole star
//! field comes off one stream, [`Purpose::StarField`], and a system comes off
//! its own; that separation is what lets the contents of systems be
//! reworked — different planets, different stations, a different number of
//! either — without the map moving under a player who had learnt it. It is
//! also why a star's *name* is generated here rather than with its system.
