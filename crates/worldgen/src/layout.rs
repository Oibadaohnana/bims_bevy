//! Whether a system is laid out legally, and the two distances that decide it.
//!
//! The rules are about **days**, not distance, and they are two:
//!
//! - **Minimum.** No two nodes closer than [`data::TRAVEL_BAND`]`.min_days`
//!   apart. A station and the body it is attached to are the one exception —
//!   they are meant to be on top of each other.
//! - **Maximum.** Every node reachable from every other through hops of at
//!   most `max_days`. Not a promise that any two things are within a
//!   fortnight of each other: a system can be longer than that end to end,
//!   as long as there is somewhere to stop on the way.
//!
//! Both are measured with [`data::REFERENCE_SHIP`], which is fixed and has
//! nothing to do with whatever the players end up flying. The checks are here
//! rather than in the generator because they are the *specification* of a
//! legal system — the generator has to satisfy them and the tests have to be
//! able to say whether it did, and those want the same code.
