//! One galaxy, generated the same way every time, and what it comes out at.
//!
//! Here rather than in the tests for the reason `shipdesign::fixture` and
//! `world::fixture` are: **two targets have to agree about it.** The lobby
//! generates the galaxy in wasm to draw the star map, and the native server
//! that will one day be authoritative generates it for x86; the only way to
//! find out whether they agree is to run a fixed seed on both and compare each
//! against the same written-down number.
//!
//! The native end is `tests.rs`; the wasm end is `lobby_galaxy_checksum_hi`
//! and `_lo` in `crates/lobby`, which `scratchpad/builder-check.mjs` reads
//! and compares against the constants below — parsed out of this file, so the
//! harness and the test are looking at one copy of the number. If one
//! target's arithmetic ever drifts from the other's, exactly one of those two
//! fails.
