//! What is in a system: its bodies, and the stations built on them.
//!
//! Generated **lazily and from a hash**, never from a running stream. Ask for
//! star 400's system and you get the same answer whether it is the first
//! system you have looked at or the nine hundredth, on a client or on a
//! server — see [`crate::rng`] for why that is worth the trouble.
//!
//! # This step places nothing
//!
//! A [`StationBlueprint`] is not a map. There are no tiles here, no rooms, no
//! items on the deck — only the facts a later map generator will need before
//! it can make any of those: what kind of station it is, how much of it is
//! wrecked, and one seed to build the interior from. Every field earns its
//! place by being something that generator either places or honours.
//!
//! # How a system gets its shape
//!
//! Constructively, outwards, one body at a time. The first goes down at a
//! seeded distance from the star; each one after it is a **hop** from
//! somewhere already placed — far enough to be a real trip, near enough to
//! reach — and is rejected and re-drawn if it lands too close to anything
//! else. Building it this way rather than scattering and checking afterwards
//! is what makes the maximum rule free: every body arrives within one hop of
//! the system it is joining, so the whole thing is connected before anybody
//! checks.
