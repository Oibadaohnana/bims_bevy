//! Where the shapes land, and where the pointer is.
//!
//! A screen paints into **canvases**: rectangles of the window, each with
//! its own view and its own shape buffer. The room's screen has one, the
//! whole of the window between the panels; the lobby's World tab has two,
//! the galaxy and the system diagram, laid out inside an egui panel like
//! any other widget. Each is tessellated into an egui mesh and painted on
//! whichever layer the screen says — the background for a canvas between
//! the panels, the panel's own for one inside it — and egui clips it to
//! the rectangle. Bevy draws nothing but the clear colour.
//!
//! The pointer is read out of egui rather than out of Bevy's input, so that
//! a click on a panel is the panel's and a click beside it is the canvas's
//! by the same rule egui uses to decide — `is_pointer_over_area` — and so a
//! text field that has the keyboard keeps it.
