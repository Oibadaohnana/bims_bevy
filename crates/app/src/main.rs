//! Bims, on a desk.
//!
//! The one binary. It opens a window, and every frame it asks whichever
//! screen is up to step its simulation, lay out its panels and paint its
//! shapes; the shapes go into one mesh (`canvas.rs`) and the panels are egui.
//! Nothing in here decides anything about the game — the room, the rules,
//! the world and the galaxy are the crates beside this one, and this crate
//! is the window, the pointer and the words.
//!
//! Seven things to run, and each is a name rather than a flag:
//!
//! ```text
//! bims               the whole game in order — menu, setup or lobby, world
//!                    and station, ship design, then the world docked where
//!                    you said
//! bims simulation    straight into the world on the playtest ship
//! bims design        straight into the yard, the playtest ship given, docked
//!                    where the simulation docks
//! bims room          the behaviour test room — Bims on a deck
//! bims test          the simulation somewhere else each time — docked at a
//!                    random station somebody lives on, in a random galaxy
//! bims combat        the fight: the combat ship — five crew, a different
//!                    gun in each hand — docked at the spawn rebuilt as the
//!                    arena and made hostile, its people enemies and more
//!                    of them than a station puts up; a recruited crew
//!                    member shoots at any it can see
//! bims stationbuilder [name]
//!                    a grid to sketch a station's rough shape on, saved as
//!                    text to `stations/<name>.txt` for a plan to be
//!                    written from
//! bims --self-check  the pinned constants, checked, and the verdict printed
//! ```
