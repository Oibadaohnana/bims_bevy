//! The game: one world, one clock, and the screen turning the crank on it.
//!
//! The design phase is over by the time any of this runs: the ship is
//! settled, it is docked at the spawn station, and what was left of the pool
//! is in the crew's hands. The crew are the room — the same simulation as
//! the behaviour test room, laid out on the ship — so the crew's panels are
//! `crew.rs`, and what this screen adds is the coordinates: a window point
//! read back through the ship's camera and heading into the room's own
//! units.
//!
//! The world advances in fixed steps and never in stretched ones: a 24x
//! step would move the ship several times its own length and a trip would
//! skip straight past its own braking phase. Speed is more steps, never
//! bigger ones.
