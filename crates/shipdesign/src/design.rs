//! A design, and the one function that changes one.
//!
//! [`apply`] is the only way a [`ShipDesign`] ever gains or loses a part, or

//! a rejected edit cannot leave a half-changed design behind, and every rule
//! about what may be placed where is in one place rather than spread through
//! whatever is driving the UI this week. The page does not mutate a design;
//! it calls this.
//!
//! # A design is the ship *and* what is in it
//!
//! [`ShipDesign::cargo`] is units aboard per [`ResourceId`], and it is part
//! of the design rather than something alongside it: it is paid for out of
//! the same pool, it is hashed into the same [`design_hash`], and the play
