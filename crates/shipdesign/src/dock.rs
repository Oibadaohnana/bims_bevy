//! Where a design meets another one: its airlock, and which way it faces
//! out.
//!
//! A ship docks at a station **airlock to airlock**. Both are designs on a
//! tile grid, so "where is the door and which way does it open" is one
//! question asked twice, and it is asked here, in integers, so that the
//! native server and the wasm client put the ship in the same place to the
//! unit. `world` turns the answer into a position and a heading; nothing in
//! this crate knows what a position is.
//!
//! The port is the **first** airlock by id, which is the rule the room uses
//! for every fixture it maps one of. A ship with two airlocks docks by the
//! one it built first.
