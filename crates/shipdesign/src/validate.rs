//! Whether a design is a ship the crew could actually live on.
//!
//! [`validate`] answers in [`Issue`]s rather than a bool, because a player
//! needs to be shown *where* the fault is. An `Error` blocks Accept; a
//! `Warning` is the design saying what it will be like to live with.
//!
//! # Where the required list comes from
//!
//! The seven fixtures below are **exactly what the test room's chains need
//! today**, and nothing else:
//!
//! - a meal is `ColdStore` → `Worktop` → `Hob` → `Table` (in a `Chair`) →
//!   `Dishwasher`;
//! - a night's sleep is a `Bunk`;
//! - a trip to the heads is a `Toilet` and then a `Basin`.
//!
//! `Bunk` and `Chair` are counted against the crew rather than merely
//! required, because two Bims cannot share one bed or one seat.
//!
//! That list is a mirror, not a design. **If stage 5 changes what a chain
//! walks to, this list changes with it** — a ship validated against a stale
//! list is a ship whose crew starve standing in front of the fixture that was
//! never required.
//!
//! # Radiation
//!
//! [`exposure`] is the other half of this file and it is not a list of
//! fixtures at all: it is a flood fill from **outside the ship** through
//! everything that does not shield. What it reaches and finds a part in is a
//! tile the outside can see into, and a Bim standing there is a Bim being
//! irradiated.
//!
//! It is a **warning**, not an error, and it is the loudest thing on the
//! page. A ship with a hole in it is a ship you can still fly, right up until
//! it is not; refusing to let a player accept one would be the design phase
//! having an opinion about how to play, and saying nothing would be letting
//! them kill the crew by accident. So: first in the list, tinted on the deck
//! whether or not anybody is pointing at the row, and never a refusal.
