//! What the workstations make, and out of what.
//!
//! One table, [`RECIPES`], and one shape of chain for all of it: a Bim
//! stands at the recipe's [`station`](Recipe::station) for its
//! [`minutes`](Recipe::minutes), and the inputs come out of the hold and the
//! output goes in. The chain is the room's (`bims::task::Kind::Craft`) and
//! the hold is the world's, so **this crate does neither** — it says what a
//! recipe is, and `crates/world` moves the cargo when the room says a Bim
//! has finished one. A native server will move the same cargo off the same
//! table.
//!
//! # Mass
//!
//! Crafting **conserves mass**: an output weighs exactly what went into it,
//! and `every_recipe_holds_together` in the tests holds the resource table
//! to that. The smelter is the one exception, written down as
//! [`Recipe::vents`]: two ore at ten is twenty, one metal is eight, and the
//! twelve is slag and is vented. A recipe may lose mass only there, and may
//! gain it nowhere. That is the two entries making things adds to the
//! list in [`crate::materials`] of what changes a ship's mass.
//!
//! # A recipe is data, a job is a station
//!
//! There is no chain per product. A new thing to make is one row here, and
//! the row says which station; the work list has one job per station
//! (`bims::work::Job::Craft` is all of them today). A target per output —
//! "keep twenty components" — is the world's, set by the player, and it is
//! what turns a row into an errand: a recipe is on offer while the hold has
//! fewer of its output than the target, the inputs for one, room for the
//! output, a bench of its station aboard, and that station powered.
