//! Mass conservation: a part weighs what it is made of, and building one
//! moves that weight rather than making it.
//!
//! Every part has a [`recipe`](crate::parts::PartDef::recipe) and
//! [`crate::parts::part_mass`] is that recipe added up. Nothing else says
//! what a part weighs. That one decision is what this module is about,
//! because it makes construction a **move**: the materials were in the hold
//! weighing something, they are in the wall weighing the same, and the ship
//! did not get heavier or lighter on the way.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! - **What a ship weighs** is the sum of [`crate::parts::part_mass`] over
//!   its parts, plus what is in the hold, plus the materials delivered to
//!   construction sites, plus the crew aboard. Sites do not exist yet — see
//!   *What is not here* — but they are in the sum so that the day they
//!   arrive they are not a hole in it.
//! - **Construction moves exactly the recipe** out of the hold, or out of the
//!   site it was delivered to, and into the part. Total mass is unchanged.
//! - **Deconstruction returns exactly the recipe**, all of it, to the hold or
//!   to a site. Total mass is unchanged. **There is no loss.** Scrapping at a
//!   penalty is a design decision nobody has taken, and a rule that quietly
//!   ate a tenth of every wall would be discovered as a ship that mysteriously
//!   lightens every time it is rebuilt.
//! - **Total mass changes through three things and no others**: trading while
//!   docked, food eaten or grown, and crew joining or leaving. Nothing is
//!   burnt in flight — the engines run on the reactor. Anything else that changes it is a bug, and this list is the
//!   thing to check it against.
//! - **Money is only usable while docked at a station.** That is where euros
//!   and materials can be swapped for each other, in either direction. The
//!   design phase is docked at the spawn station, which is why everything in
//!   it is instant and paid for in euros; away from a station, what gets built
//!   comes out of the hold or does not get built.
//!
//! # Where the mass is, which is not the same question
//!
//! Total mass is conserved. **The centre of mass is not**, and neither is the
//! inertia about it: a part is at its tile centres, and the cargo and the crew
//! are at the centre of mass itself for want of anywhere better to put them.
//! So welding the hold's metal into an engine at the stern moves the centre of
//! mass aft without changing a gram of the total. Nothing reads that yet —
//! [`crate::mass`] is a single figure — and it is written down here so that
//! whatever does read it knows the total was the only thing promised.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! Loose items on the deck, scrap, and any attempt to balance an instant
//! part's price against what its materials cost. [`build_from_cargo`] and
//! [`deconstruct_to_cargo`] are the **rule**, not the mechanism: the
//! construction step in `world` drives the first with a Bim and a site in
//! the middle of it — materials hauled to a site are *reserved* in the hold,
//! never taken out of it, so the sum above holds at every step, and the
//! whole recipe leaves the hold in the one call that puts the part down.
//! Nothing calls the second yet.
