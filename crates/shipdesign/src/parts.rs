//! What a ship can be built out of.
//!
//! One table, [`PARTS`], with one entry per [`PartKind`] in discriminant
//! order. Every number in it is a **placeholder** — nothing here has been
//! balanced against anything, and the recipes and prices exist so that the
//! rules in [`crate::design`] and [`crate::validate`] have something real to
//! be exercised against.
//!
//! What is *not* a placeholder is the shape of the table. The discriminants
//! cross the wasm boundary as numbers and will one day be in a save file, so
//! they are written out and **never renumbered**: a new part is appended, a
//! retired one leaves a hole.
//!
//! # A part is made of something, and weighs what it is made of
//!
//! [`PartDef::recipe`] is the materials one is built from — metal and
//! components, never ore and never food — and [`part_mass`] is that recipe
//! added up. There is deliberately **no mass column**: a part that weighed
//! something other than its materials would gain or lose mass every time one
//! was built, and the whole of [`crate::materials`] is the promise that it
//! does not.
//!
//! [`PartDef::price`] is the other half and it is **independent**. It is what
//! a finished part costs in euros at a station, where money and materials can
//! be swapped for each other; away from one there is no price, only the
//! recipe. Nothing works one out from the other, and nothing should — an
//! instant part bought at the dock and a part welded up out of the hold are
//! two different transactions that happen to end in the same wall.
//!
//! # Four layers, and what holds what up
//!
//! A tile holds at most one part per [`Layer`], and a part can say what has
//! to be there already through [`PartDef::requires`]:
//!
//! - **Structure** is the frame the ship is built on. It needs nothing under
//!   it and everything else is over it, directly or through the deck.
//! - **Floor** is the deck plating you walk on. It needs structure.
//! - **Object** is the one thing standing in the tile — a wall, a bunk, an
//!   engine. Most need deck; a wall, an outside wall, a sensor array and a
//!   thruster are hull and stand straight on structure.
//! - **Utility** is what runs *through* a tile without filling it: conduit.
//!   It needs structure and nothing stands on it.
//!
//! # Shielding
//!
//! [`PartDef::shields`] is what keeps the radiation out — see
//! [`crate::validate::exposure`]. It is a property of the **part**, not of
//! the hull: an outside wall shields, a plain internal wall does not, and a
//! door does not, so a ship walled in ordinary walls is a ship the crew are
//! being cooked in.
