//! A trip, worked out once and then read at a time.
//!
//! # Why it is closed form
//!
//! The same trip is flown by a browser stepping sixty times a second, by a
//! player holding 24x, and one day by a native server catching up on an hour
//! of somebody's disconnection in a single call. Those three have to agree
//! about where the ship is, and the only way to make that true rather than
//! hope it is to never integrate: a [`Plan`] is a fixed list of segments with
//! fixed durations, and [`state_at`] evaluates position, velocity and heading
//! **from the elapsed minutes alone**. Nothing accumulates, nothing has a
//! tick of its own, and calling it with 0, then 3, then 3.5 gives the same
//! answers as calling it with 3.5.
//!
//! That is the same rule `crates/health` is built on, for the same reason —
//! see its note about cutting an interval at every boundary. Here there is
//! nothing to cut, because there is nothing that changes rate inside a
//! segment.
//!
//! # The shape of a trip
//!
//! Everything happens along one straight line: the ship turns to face the
//! arrival point, burns towards it, and stops on it.
//!
//! 1. **Align** — turn to the bearing. Bang-bang: full angular acceleration
//!    for half the turn, full deceleration for the other half, so the ship
//!    starts and finishes at rest. Skipped when already pointing there.
//! 2. **Burn** — the forward engines, as hard as the reactor feeds them
//!    (`shipdesign::power::thrust`; there is no fuel, and the throttle is
//!    in the [`Dynamics`] already).
//! 3. **Brake** — one of two, whichever is quicker:
//!    - **flip**: coast through a half turn, then the *same* forward engines
//!      pointing the other way;
//!    - **backward engines**: no turn at all, and only if there are any.
//! 4. **Arrive** — docked if the target is a station and the ship has an
//!    airlock, holding otherwise.
//!
//! There is no coasting phase in the middle and no speed limit. A trip is
//! flat out to the changeover and braking from there, which is the same shape
//! `physics::travel_days` quotes and the same one the world generator laid its
//! systems out against.
