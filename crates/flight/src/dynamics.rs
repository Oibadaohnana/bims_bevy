//! What a design does when you push it: how heavy it is, where its weight
//! sits, how hard it accelerates and how fast it turns.
//!
//! All of it is derived from the design and **nothing here is stored on one**.
//! A ship that gains a wall is a different ship to fly, and the one call that
//! says so is [`dynamics`] — `world::World::on_ship_changed` is the only place
//! that is meant to be called from, precisely so there is one moment at which
//! a ship's flying changes rather than a scattering of them.
//!
//! The engines in it are the ones the reactor feeds — `shipdesign::power::thrust`
//! — at the push it can feed them. There is no fuel; a ship with a dark
//! engine has no engine, and one with more engine than reactor has a slower
//! ship.
//!
//! # Two simplifications, both deliberate
//!
//! - **A main engine produces no torque**, wherever it is bolted. Its push
//!   goes through the centre of mass. The alternative is a ship that spins
//!   because a player laid it out symmetrically to the eye and not to the
//!   gram, with nothing on the page to say why and nothing they could do about
//!   it.
//! - **Cargo and crew sit at the centre of mass.** They count towards the
//!   total — an engine has to push them — and they move neither the centre of
//!   mass nor the inertia, because where a crate is stowed and where a Bim is
//!   standing are questions this crate has no way to ask.
//!
//! Both are written down here rather than discovered later: they are the two
//! things somebody adding a cargo-position model would have to undo.
