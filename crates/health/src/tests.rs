//! Native tests for the health model.
//!
//! These run under `cargo test --target <native> -p health`, which is what
//! `nix flake check` does. The crate compiles for wasm as well and has to
//! give the same answers there; nothing in here is a `usize` or a hash, so
//! the only wasm half of the check is that it builds, which the flake's
//! `--workspace` wasm build covers.
//!
//! The three scenarios are the requirement rather than the numbers in
//! `data.rs`. If a value there moves, what should be argued about is whether
//! these three still describe the game that is wanted:
//!
//! - **A** — a shift outside. Costs health, all of it comes back.
//! - **B** — a day outside. Survivable, and the body carries a cancer for
//!   the rest of its life.
//! - **C** — that cancer, left alone. Fatal in under six weeks.
