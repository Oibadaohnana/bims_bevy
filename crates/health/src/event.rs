//! What just happened to a body, for whoever is watching.
//!
//! [`crate::update`] hands back a list of these and they are the **only**
//! thing that says a line was crossed. A caller that wants to say "James is
//! ill" watches for the event; a caller that wants to draw a bar reads the
//! state. Polling the state for a change instead would miss a crossing that
//! happened and reversed inside one update, which is exactly what a long
//! step does.
//!
//! One event per transition, in the order the transitions happened, however
//! long the step. An update that takes a Bim from nothing to radiation
//! sickness emits all three in order — the same three, in the same order,
//! that a minute-by-minute run would emit.
//!
//! No strings. The host names them, the way it names every other code that
//! crosses the boundary — see `MEMORY_LINES` in `crates/app/src/names.rs` for the shape
//! this will take when it gets there.

/// The discriminants are written out because they will cross the wasm
/// boundary as numbers, and a reordered enum must not silently renumber
/// anything. `0` is left free for "nothing happened", which is the shape
/// every other code in this workspace has.
