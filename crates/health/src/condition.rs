//! What is wrong with a body, and what each of those costs it.
//!
//! Health is not driven by a pile of special cases: it is driven by a **list
//! of conditions**, and a condition is four numbers — how much health it
//! takes per minute, whether it stops the body mending, and what it does to
//! how fast the body works and walks. [`crate::update`] never asks "is this
//! Bim irradiated"; it asks for the conditions in force and adds them up.
//!
//! Radiation and cancer are the first two kinds. Hunger, sleep loss and
//! filth are meant to arrive as further variants of [`Condition`] with rows
//! of their own in [`Condition::effect`], and nothing else should have to
//! change when they do. They are **not** ported here: the room's
//! `crates/game/src/health.rs` still owns those, and moving them is its own
//! step.
//!
//! Two conventions the rest of the crate leans on:
//!
//! - **A band is closed at the bottom.** A dose of exactly [`CRITICAL`] is
//!   critical, exactly [`SICKNESS`] is sickness. [`RadiationStage::of`] is
//!   the one place that is decided, and reversing it is the same table read
//!   backwards — there is no separate ladder for a dose coming down.
//! - **Stages are ordered and adjacent.** [`RadiationStage::rung`] numbers
//!   them 0 to 3 and a crossing only ever moves one rung at a time, which is
//!   what lets a single update that goes from nothing to sickness emit the
//!   two events in between rather than one event naming where it ended up.
