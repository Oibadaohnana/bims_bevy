//! One body's health, and the one function that moves it.
//!
//! # The order inside an update
//!
//! Dose first, then the stages it puts the body in, then mending, then
//! damage, then the clamp, then the death check — and **death is checked
//! last and is final**. That order is the lesson from the room's
//! `crates/game/src/health.rs`, written down there as a comment and repeated
//! here because it cost a bug: health that mends every frame will otherwise
//! undo a killing blow before anything has looked at whether the body is
//! dead, and the run ends with a Bim reading nought health and still walking
//! about. Here it cannot happen twice over: everything that does damage also
//! suppresses mending, and the moment health reaches nothing the update
//! stops dead rather than carrying on through the rest of the interval.
//!
//! # Why an update is cut into segments
//!
//! [`update`] must give the same answer for one step of a day as for 1440
//! steps of a minute. The play phase will call it every frame with a
//! fraction of a minute, a fast-forward will call it with hours, and a
//! native server catching up on a disconnection will call it with a day —
//! and all three have to agree, or the same ship gives two answers about who
//! survived.
//!
//! Rates are only constant *between* boundaries, so the interval is cut at
//! every boundary it crosses — a dose threshold, a dose reaching nothing,
//! cancer beginning, cancer advancing, health reaching full or nothing — and
//! each piece is applied in closed form at a rate that does not change
//! inside it. Nothing here integrates numerically and nothing here has a
//! fixed internal tick, both of which would make the answer depend on how
//! the caller happened to chop the time up.
