//! The game, as the browser sees it: a world, two cameras, and the pointer.
//!
//! Every rule is next door in `crates/world` and `crates/flight`, which render
//! nothing and know nothing about a canvas. Nothing in here decides whether a
//! trip can be flown or what a step does; it asks, it draws the answer, and it
//! passes the player's orders along.
//!
//! # The page drives the clock, and that is deliberate
//!
//! [`Game::step`] advances the world by exactly one step and nothing else
//! decides how many of those happen. `crates/app/src/screens/game.rs` keeps an accumulator, works
//! out how many steps a frame is worth at the effective speed, and calls this
//! that many times. Putting the accumulator in here would mean the wasm had an
//! opinion about real time, which is the one thing it has no way to measure.
//!
//! # Commands are queued, not applied
//!
//! A command from the page is put on a list and handed to the **next** step.
//! That is what makes the stamp `crates/app/src/screens/game.rs` puts on it mean something: a
//! command applies at a step, the same step for everybody, and a transport
//! that arrives late has something to compare against. Applying one the
//! instant a button is pressed would work perfectly and would be impossible to
//! wire a network into later.
