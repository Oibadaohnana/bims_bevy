//! The inside of the ship: pictures of the parts the room has none for.
//!
//! The room aboard draws its own fixtures — the galley, the heads, the
//! table, the bunks, the bay, the locker — with the pictures in
//! `crates/game/src/room.rs`, and `hull` draws the skin and everything that
//! fires. What is left is what a body walks past between them: the helm,
//! the shelves, the shower, the bulkheads and the doors in them, the conduit
//! under the deck (which is [`conduit`], apart from [`part`], because it
//! needs the grid to know which way it runs). Those used to be a coloured block a tile, which is what
//! the design phase still shows and is fine at eight pixels a tile; at the
//! game's scale a block is a hole in the picture, and a station with rooms
//! in it is mostly bulkhead.
//!
//! Drawn in **design space** like `hull`, in each part's own frame through
//! [`hull::Local`] — `u` across the part, `v` along it towards whoever uses
//! it, which is grid down for a part at `R0` — so a helm turned to face
//! the stern is drawn turned with it and its seat is still on the side the
//! Bim stands. The palette is the room's, so the two halves of the picture
//! read as one deck.
