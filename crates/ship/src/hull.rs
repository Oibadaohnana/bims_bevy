//! The outside of the ship, and what it is doing to itself.
//!
//! Pictures of the hull's working parts — the plating, the engines, the
//! thrusters, the airlock, the array — and the exhaust behind them when they
//! fire. Everything in here is drawn in **design space**: world units, `y`
//! down, about the design's origin, which is the frame every tile was laid
//! out in. `world_paint` turns the whole picture with the ship afterwards, so
//! nothing here has heard of a heading.
//!
//! # What fires, and which way
//!
//! [`Firing`] is [`flight::Effort`] read against the design, and it is the
//! only thing the exhaust is drawn from — the same closed-form plan the
//! ship's position comes from, so the flame is behind the ship at 24x and
//! after an hour's catch-up exactly as it is at 1x.
//!
//! An engine burns when it faces the way the ship is being pushed: a
//! forward engine through the burn and through a flip brake, a backward
//! engine through a brake without one, and one bolted sideways never — the
//! autopilot does not fly it, so it is dead weight and drawn as such.
//!
//! A thruster has a nozzle on every side of it that faces open space, and
//! **which nozzle fires is worked out from where it is**: exhaust out of a
//! nozzle pushes the ship the other way, and that push turns the ship about
//! its centre of mass one way or the other. The nozzle whose turn matches the
//! plan's is the one lit. The dynamics never look at where a thruster is —
//! four of them turn the ship the same however they are placed — but the
//! picture does, because a corner thruster puffing *into* the hull is a
//! picture that says the ship is broken.
