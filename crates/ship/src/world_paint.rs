//! Drawing the game: the ship at tile scale, and the system on a map.
//!
//! # The one piece of geometry that matters
//!
//! The camera never rotates, so the **ship** does. A point in the design grid
//! lands on screen at
//!
//! ```text
//! screen = R(heading) · (design − centre_of_mass)
//! ```
//!
//! where `R` turns clockwise in a y-down coordinate system — which is exactly
//! what the canvas's own `rotate()` does, so each tile is emitted with `rot`
//! set to the heading and the host turns it.
//!
//! That is not a second opinion about which way round the ship is. It falls
//! out of `flight::angle::rotate_design` and the screen's y-flip — a rotation
//! composed with the flip between the grid's y-down and the system's y-up. The
//! tests next door are what keep the two in step:
//! `a_screen_point_maps_back_to_the_tile_it_is_over` reads this arithmetic
//! backwards at four headings, and it fails the moment a sign here moves.
//!
//! # What is never turned with the ship
//!
//! The starfield and anything drawn because it is *out there* — a station
//! alongside, everything on the map. Those are in the world, and the world
//! does not tip over when the ship does.
//!
//! # Head up
//!
//! The one exception is the player's to switch on: `Game::head_up` turns the
//! *camera* instead, by the heading undone, so the ship is drawn the way it
//! was laid out and the sky and the map turn round it. Nothing above changes
//! shape — the ship goes through `Game::ship_turn`, which is the heading plus
//! the camera's turn, and everything out there is pushed square to the
//! window as before and then turned by `Game::camera_turn` after the fact
//! (`DrawList::turn_from`). North up, both turns are what they always were.
