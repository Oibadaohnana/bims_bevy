//! **This is a deliberate copy** of the room's `crates/game/src/draw.rs`, not

//! page. The *code* is not, because the room is a crate the designer has no
//! business importing: nothing here may reach into `room.rs`, `nav.rs` or
//! `task.rs`, and an import of `draw` would be the first crack in that.
//!
//! If the format ever changes it changes in two files, and the host reads the
//! stride at runtime from whichever wasm it loaded so the two can differ
