//! Drawing a design, as rectangles and ellipses.
//!
//! The parts are drawn as the game draws them: the hull's skin and engines
//! by `hull`, the fittings by `fittings`, and the room's own fixtures —
//! the galley, the heads, the bunks — by the room, laid out from the design
//! as it stands ([`fixtures`], cached on the editor and redone with the
//! issues). What has no picture yet is a block of its colour with a bar on
//! the side it is used from, and so is the ghost of whatever is about to be
//! placed.
//!
//! The palette is the repo's: the deck greys and the cyan glow out of
//! `room.rs`, so the designer and the room look like one game.
//!
//! The colours are also what the host paints its palette swatches with —
//! they cross the boundary as numbers through `ship_part_color_*`, so the
//! button for a hob cannot end up a different colour from the hob.
