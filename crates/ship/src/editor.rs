//! The design phase as a state machine: one design, one pool of money, one
//! camera, and everybody's Accept.
//!
//! Every rule about what may be placed where is in `shipdesign` and none of
//! it is repeated here. What is here is the part that only makes sense with a
//! pointer in it — which tool is picked, which way the ghost is turned, what
//! a drag covers — plus the two pieces of bookkeeping that belong to the
//! *session* rather than to the design: who has accepted, and whether the
//! phase is over.
//!
//! # Accepts, and what clears them
//!
//! An Accept is recorded **against a hash**, never against "the design". Any
//! successful edit by anybody changes the hash and clears every Accept, which
//! is the whole of the protocol: there is no way to be holding an Accept for
//! a ship that is no longer on screen.
