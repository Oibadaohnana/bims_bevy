//! The camera the game view is drawn through.
//!
//! **North is up and it never rotates.** Not in the ship view, not on the map,
//! not while the ship is turning end over end. A camera that followed the
//! heading would be the one that made a flip legible and every other moment
//! unreadable — you could not tell which way you were going because "which
//! way" would always look the same.
//!
//! So the *ship* rotates on screen instead, drawn through its heading, and
//! everything else — the starfield, a station drawn alongside, the map — stays
//! square to the window.
//!
//! That is the default and not the only way: `Game::head_up` is the player
//! asking for the other one, the ship held square and the world turned round
//! it, and it is done in `world_paint` by turning what is out there after the
//! fact rather than by anything in here. This camera still never rotates;
//! `Game::camera_turn` is the whole of the difference.
//!
//! The transform is the same one the design phase's [`crate::view::View`]
//! hands out (`screen = world * scale + offset`), so `crates/app` paints
//! either page with one loop. The difference is what the origin is: the design
//! phase's is the corner of the build area, and this one is **the ship** —
//! everything in the ship view is drawn in the camera's units about the
//! ship's centre of mass.
//!
//! What sits in the *middle* of the window is a different question, and it
//! is [`Camera::focus`]: a point in those same units that the pan is
//! measured from and clamped about. In the ship view it is the crew member
//! the player steers, set every frame (`Game::follow_player`), so the view
//! follows them off the ship and through a station's airlock and can never
//! be dragged until they are off the edge. On the map it is nought — the
//! ship — while it follows, and a place in the system held still under a
//! moving ship when it is let go (`Game::map_anchor`).
//!
//! That is the camera **tethered**, and it can also be let [`loose`]
//! (`Game::follow` off): then nobody sets the focus, a pan moves the focus
//! itself and nothing clamps it — a free camera, for looking at the far
//! end of a station while the crew are busy at this one. The two are one
//! camera and one transform; which of the pan and the focus a drag moves is
//! the whole difference, so a view let loose stays exactly where it was
//! and a view tethered again snaps back to its subject on the next frame.
//!
//! [`loose`]: Camera::set_loose
