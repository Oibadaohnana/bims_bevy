//! The geometry of the game view.
//!
//! **An exception to "the cdylibs' tests are the probes and the harnesses",
//! and a narrow one.** Almost everything in this crate is browser-shaped —
//! a pointer, a ghost, a shape buffer — and is checked by
//! `scratchpad/ship-check.mjs` running the real page against the real wasm.
//! What is below is not: it is the arithmetic that turns a design tile into a
//! place on screen and back, it is pure, and getting it wrong looks like a
//! ship you cannot click on rather than like an error. That is worth a unit
//! test, so the crate is an `rlib` as well as a `cdylib` and
//! `nix flake check` runs this with the rest.
