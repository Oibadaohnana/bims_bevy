//! The ship physics contract.
//!
//! Three questions, answered by pure functions over plain data: what does a
//! ship weigh, what does that do to its engines, and how long is the trip.
//! There is no ECS here, no buildables, no ship — a ship is whatever the
//! caller hands in, as a hull mass, a cargo manifest and a list of engines.
//!
//! It is its own crate because three different things need the same answers
//! and must not each work them out their own way: the **world generator**
//! needs them now, to check that the bodies it scatters through a system are
//! a sane number of days apart; the **builder** will need them to tell a
//! player what the ship they are welding together will fly like; and the
//! **flight step** will need them to fly it. Two of those three do not exist
//! yet, which is exactly why this is written down as a contract rather than
//! discovered later inside whichever one is built first.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! Distance is in world units — the same ones positions are measured in, and
//! deliberately not given a name in metres, because nothing yet depends on
//! one. Time is the `time` crate's base unit, the **game minute**. So an
//! acceleration is world units per minute squared, and it is worth saying out
//! loud because the number looks strange otherwise: the reference ship's
//! forward acceleration is `1.0`, which covers half a million units in a day.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **Rotation.** [`Facing`] is the ship's own frame — forward, backward,
//! left, right — and turning that into a heading through space is
//! `crates/flight`'s business, not this crate's. It was undecided when this
//! was written and it is decided now: a heading is 0 at north and grows
//! clockwise, and the ship's Forward is the design grid's up. Nothing here
//! needed changing for that, which is the point of the split.
//!
//! **Anything that changes over time.** Mass is constant for the length of a
//! trip; it is recalculated on discrete events only — a build, a
//! deconstruction, a load, an unload, a crew member joining or leaving — and
//! never continuously.
//!
//! **Fuel.** There is a burn now, and it is deliberately not here. The rule is
//! `crates/flight`'s and it is worth stating because it is what keeps this
//! crate's "mass is constant for a trip" true: fuel is **reserved** when a
//! trip is confirmed, **burnt** over the engine phases, and **taken out of the
//! hold at the end of the plan** — not continuously. So a ship does not get
//! lighter on the way, a plan's mass is fixed for its whole duration, and the
//! arrival time quoted at departure is the arrival time. Making the burn
//! continuous would make every one of those three false at once.
