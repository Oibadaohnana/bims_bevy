//! One number that says whether two copies of the world agree.
//!
//! Nothing uses it yet. It is here for the same reason `design_hash` was here
//! before there was a lobby: the moment there is a transport, a client and a
//! server will each be running [`crate::World::step`] and the only cheap way
//! to find out that they have drifted is to compare a number every so often.
//! Writing it now means the *loop* is designed to be comparable rather than
//! being made comparable later.
//!
//! # Why the floats are rounded
//!
//! FNV-1a over the raw bits of an `f64` would be exact, and exactness is
//! precisely the problem. Everything here that is not arithmetic is `sin`,
//! `cos`, `atan2` and `sqrt`; the first three come out of the platform's libm
//! on native and out of Rust's own on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and those two
//! are allowed to differ in the last bit. A checksum that noticed a
//! last-bit disagreement would fire constantly and say nothing.
//!
//! So every float is rounded onto a grid on the way in: positions to a
//! thousandth of a world unit, which is a hundred-thousandth of a tile, and
//! angles and speeds to a millionth. A real divergence — a ship that set off
//! and one that did not, a purchase one side made and the other did not — is
//! orders of magnitude larger than either grid. A rounding difference is
//! invisible. That is the trade, and it is the right way round.
//!
//! The one thing that is **not** rounded is the design: `shipdesign` is
//! integers throughout precisely so its hash is exact on both targets, and
//! that hash goes in whole.
