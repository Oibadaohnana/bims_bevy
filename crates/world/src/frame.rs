//! Whether the view is about a place or about the space between places.
//!
//! **It affects the view and nothing else.** Not the clock, not the speed, not
//! the physics — the ship flies exactly the same trip whether the renderer has
//! decided to draw a station beside it or not. That is worth stating because
//! it is the kind of thing that grows teeth: a "local frame" in another game
//! would be a different coordinate system, or a different tick rate, or a
//! place where docking is allowed. Here it is which picture is drawn.
//!
//! A ship is in a node's frame when it is **there for that node** — docked at
//! it, holding beside it, or on the last leg of a trip aimed at it — and
//! within its radius. Flying *past* something on the way somewhere else never
//! changes the frame, however close the pass: the view should be about where
//! you are going, not about whatever you happened to sail by.
