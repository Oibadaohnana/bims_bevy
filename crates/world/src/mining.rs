//! A mining site: the asteroids about a belt, as tiles a Bim mines on foot.
//!
//! A belt is a point on the map. Hold station at one and it becomes a
//! **place**: a field of asteroids laid out round the ship, each a blob of
//! tiles on the ship's own tile grid, close enough that a walk to the
//! nearest is minutes rather than hours. The ship is what the rocks are laid
//! out about — the field is generated when the ship first comes to rest at
//! the belt, from the belt's own seed, in the frame the ship is holding in —
//! so a suited Bim walks the same grid outside that it walks inside, and a
//! click on a rock is the same tile arithmetic as a click on the deck.
//!
//! # What an asteroid is made of
//!
//! Skin and core. Every tile within [`CORE_DEPTH`] of the outside is bare
//! [`Rock::Stone`], and only the tiles deeper than that are the ore — iron
//! on most of them, [`Rock::Galvum`] on about one asteroid in ten
//! ([`GALVUM_SHARE`]). So an asteroid has to be dug into, three tiles deep,
//! before it gives anything worth having, and which of them is the purple
//! one is visible from outside: the core shows through.
//!
//! # What the crew are told
//!
//! Nothing is mined that the player has not **marked**. A mark is a
//! [`crate::world::Command`], so two players' ships agree about which
//! rocks are wanted, and the room is handed the marked tiles that still
//! stand, every step, with every rock tile as something to walk round —
//! see `World::eva_offer`. What a tile yields when it is gone is
//! [`yield_of`], and it is the world's to add to the hold.
