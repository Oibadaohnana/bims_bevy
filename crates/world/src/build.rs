//! Construction: a part of the ship laid out by the player and put
//! together by the crew, out of what is in the hold.
//!
//! A [`BuildSite`] is a part that is not there yet — a kind, a tile and a
//! turn, the same three numbers a placement in the design phase is — and
//! what has been carried to it. The crew haul its recipe to it a load at a
//! time off the shelves and then put it together beside it, and when they
//! have, the part is placed through `shipdesign::build_from_cargo` exactly
//! as the design phase would have placed it, paid for in materials. Stage 7
//! of [`crate::World::step`] is where all of that lands.
//!
//! # The materials never leave the hold until the part goes down
//!
//! A load "carried to a site" is a **reservation** on the hold, not a move
//! out of it: [`BuildSite::delivered`] and [`BuildSite::carrying`] count
//! units the crew have spoken for, and the count on the shelf is untouched
//! until `build_from_cargo` takes the whole recipe in one go. That keeps
//! the contract in `shipdesign::materials` true at every step — the ship
//! weighs its parts plus its hold, and nothing is in transit weighing
//! nothing — and it means a site given up costs nothing to give up. What
//! the reservation does is keep the metal from being sold or smelted out
//! from under the site: [`crate::World::free`] is what is aboard less what
//! the sites have claimed, and every hand that reaches for the hold asks
//! that rather than the raw count.
//!
//! # The ship does not move while it is built on, and is not built on while it moves
//!
//! Both halves are the world's to keep. A site is only placed, and the
//! crew only sent to one, while the ship is at rest — docked or holding —
//! and a Confirm is refused while any site has something carried to it or
//! a Bim on the way to it. A blueprint with nothing done at it does not
//! hold the ship: it is a plan, and a plan can wait.
