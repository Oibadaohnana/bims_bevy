//! How fast the world runs, and who decides.
//!
//! **Everybody, and the slowest wins.** There is one world and one clock in
//! it, so a speed is not a per-player view setting the way a camera is — it is
//! a change to what happens. Taking the slowest request means nobody is ever
//! carried past something they wanted to look at, and a pause by anybody is a
//! pause, which is the one control that has to work the instant it is asked
//! for.
//!
//! The alternative — a majority, or whoever asked last — was considered and is
//! worse in the one case that matters: the player who needs it slow is the
//! player something is going wrong for.
