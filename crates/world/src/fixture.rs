//! One world, opened the same way every time.
//!
//! Here rather than in the tests for the reason `shipdesign::fixture` is:
//! **two targets have to agree about it.** The browser runs
//! [`World::step`](crate::World::step) in wasm and the native server that will
//! one day be authoritative runs the same loop for x86, and the only way to
//! find out whether they agree is to run a fixed scenario on both and compare
//! each against the same written-down number.
//!
//! The native end is `tests.rs`; the wasm end is `ship_self_check` in
//! `crates/ship`, which the node harness reads. Both compare against
//! [`REFERENCE_CHECKSUM`]. If one target's arithmetic ever drifts from the
//! other's, exactly one of those two fails.
